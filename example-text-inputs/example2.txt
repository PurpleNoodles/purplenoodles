The reason for my resignation is because I couldn't find time to handle the large amount of workload at this company. If I may, and I could make a suggestion, with all due respect, I would prefer if team leaders be less authoratitive and more cooperative. Thank you for all the oppourtunities you provided, I wish the best for your company.
